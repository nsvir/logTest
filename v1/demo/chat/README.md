To run the application, you must have jdk-7 installed(and path for java must be set in operating system).

Migrate to the master directory containing `Server.java` & `Client.java` files.
Open the terminal and type the following commands:

  `javac Server.java` - to compile the Server.java file.
  
  `javac Client.java` - to compile the Client.java file.
  
  `java Server` - to run the server.

  `java Client` - to run the client.

Now the client and the server can communicate.
